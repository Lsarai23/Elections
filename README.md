# Elections

Hey guys! 🖐️

This is a Elections Simulator in Python.

Here you can:

- Create voters and candidates
- See the results
- See some statistics

This project has a lot of errors of no validation of inputs, so I expect to be fixing them in the next days.🤦‍♂️ <br>
I've done it when I was at the beggining of my bachelor degree.
